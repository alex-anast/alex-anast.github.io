# My Personal Website - alex-anast

## TODO -- Update

Move to Astro -- see templates like:

- https://www.devportfoliotemplates.com/portfolio-templates/modern-minimal
- This in general: https://www.devportfoliotemplates.com/
- From Karolina: https://karikowska.github.io/

Astro seems to beat Hugo in terms of modern design and flexibility, I don't know how difficult it is to set it up though. It seems like a choice that will remain though. And I wonder if I can set it up quickly by using agents.

## TODO

- [X] Make a tad bit lighter the wallpaper
- [X] Remove the key sections -> experiment with ToC but probably not needed either. Redundancy
- [X] Personal description -> make it longer and fun (personal)
- [X] Remove previous/next if possible
- [X] Remove the `about` page
- [X] CV: link, if possible -> plot
- [ ] CV: share on LI and email, not the rest
- [ ] previous and next should be removed in general
- [X] CV: remove related except if you can only stick to blogs
- [ ] Fix timeline (optional) + think of UX w/ Marietta
