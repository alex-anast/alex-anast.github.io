# My Personal Website - alex-anast

## TODO

- [X] Make a tad bit lighter the wallpaper
- [X] Remove the key sections -> experiment with ToC but probably not needed either. Redundancy
- [ ] Personal description -> make it longer and fun (personal)
- [ ] Remove previous/next if possible
- [ ] Remove the `about` page
- [ ] CV: link, if possible -> plot
- [ ] CV: share on LI and email, not the rest
- [ ] previous and next should be removed in general
- [ ] CV: remove related except if you can only stick to blogs
