## My Story

AI engineer with a passion for Generative AI, currently making waves in the pharma industry. Originally hailing from the beautiful landscapes of Greece, I've honed my skills with a year in embedded software and another in DevOps CI and automation.

My journey is driven by a relentless pursuit to become an AI expert and build interesting stuff.
